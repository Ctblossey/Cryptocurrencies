# CryptoCurrencies

## Overview
### The purpose of this exercise was to extend our unsupervised learning skills to a dataset of CryptoCurrencies. Through the steps of processing the data, reducing data dimensions, clustering with K-means, and visualizing; we were able to make key takeaways. By the end of our analysis we were able to make a sound recommendation between the total coins mined and the total coin supply.
